#The Bloch Sphere
The Bloch Sphere represents the result of an isomorphism between the space of possible state vectors of a two level system and the complex projective line.

 The most in terms of vectors in the projective Hilbert Space. An unique representation of the state of a quantum system is furnished by the normalised state vector $|\psi \rangle $. The requirement of normalisation - if 5$|\psi \rangle $ can be changed into $|\psi \rangle $ with no conceptual cost - represents an excess of information. 



There is a natural extension to n dimensions that is less useful - the parameters describing the sphere no longer represent such visuablisable quantities
